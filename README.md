# Snapin

> A formula: **Snapin** = Snap + Pin

This is a simple tool for macOS, which allows you to frame a region on screen and pin that area. That is, snapshot and show the snapshot in a topmost window.

This project is nearly finished, and I will submit it to Mac App Store as soon as it is fully completed.

## Usage
This tool is pretty straightforward, once you launched it, there will be a **"S"** icon on your status bar. By clicking it can you open the app menu. Snapin also supports hotkey, which is pretty convenient. When you start to take a snapshot, your desktop will go dim and then select a region by drawing a rectangle.

## Installation
* Download directly from Mac App Store (Coming soon)
* Clone this repo, and build it manually:
